NOTES
- Keep all three files in the same directory.
- The page loads HLS.js from cdnjs and the India channel playlist from iptv-org.
  Those external services must be reachable for their features to work.
- The existing embedded player URLs are third-party sources from the supplied HTML.
  Their availability, authorization, and embedding permissions are not verified.
  Use only streams you are authorized to distribute or embed.
- Some third-party pages may block iframe embedding or playback; hosting the page
  does not control those restrictions.
